## Description

The app allows users to view create and track daily workouts. Users are able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day and track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of the exercise or, ff the exercise is a cardio exercise, track the distance traveled. This app requires a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handle routes with Express.
